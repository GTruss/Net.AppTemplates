# README
Base projects/templates for creating .NET 5 Console, WinForms and Web API applications. More projects will be added as-needed and as time allows (basically, when I get bored and want to work on it).

Nothing special here. Just my own, personal .Net 5 application templates that I can use for future development.

If someone else finds use in these, that's great. Feel free. I'm open to suggestions for improvement or methodology recommendations but no guarantees they will be implemented. Make a PR and we'll talk. :)
